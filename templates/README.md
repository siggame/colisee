# Creating a New Project

## Project Type

Choosing a project type will depend on the purpose of said project.

* Service

  * A service is an application which is a component within a larger encompassing architecture.

* Library

  * A library is a collection of modules which are together meant to be used as a building block for applications.

## Project Name

* Service

  * Prefix the name of the parent project (eg. `colisee-runner` where `colisee` is the parent and `runner` is the service)

* Library

  * Optionally prefix the name of the parent project if the library doesn't meet general purpose needs (eg. `colisee-lib` vs. `tourneyjs`).
